# Project Tite: Food For Thought

# User Story
User is an indecisive individual that cannot choose what he/she wants
So how would this app help? Well, we decide for them

User is asked different variables (questions) on topics regarding food
It can go two ways:
-Fully random
-Distance, Allergies, Dine in or takeout,budget (money willing to spend)

-More defined (can be added as an additional question)
-what type of food?(specific types i.e. chinese, mexican, japanese, italian, American, Brazilian)
